    "This site a set of lecture notes (the \"book\") for the Python components of IST-5551 offered at the Department of Business and Information Technology of Missouri S&T in Rolla, Missouri. I have used Dr. Allen Downey's [Think Python](https://allendowney.github.io/ThinkPython/) and deeply enjoyed the book. Build on Dr. Downey's effort, I would like to adapt Dr. Downey's book to fit my students' needs."

    "## At a Glance\n",
    "\n",
    "Each chapter in this book builds on the previous ones, so you should read them in order and take time to work on the exercises before you move on.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fundamentals**: The basic elements like statements and expressions, operators, data types, conditionals, and loops. They also introduce the most important concept in programming, functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Structures**: Python's core data structures -- lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets -- which are powerful tools for writing efficient programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Text Analysis**: Strings represent letters, words, and sentences – and accompanying methods for working with them. Chapter  10 presents algorithms for analyzing text and generating new text randomly. Algorithms like these are at the core of large language models (LLMs), so this chapter will give you an idea about the interwork of general AI tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **OOP**: Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a way to organize programs and the data they work with. Many Python libraries are written in object-oriented style, so these chapters will help you understand their design -- and define your own objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Applications**: Select topics such as algorithms, including searching and storing data, and select topics such as exception handling, modules and packages, and common data science modules. "
