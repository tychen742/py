    "This is a set of lecture notes (the \"book\" or \"site\") for the Python components of a 5000-level course at Missouri S&T. I have used Allen Downey's [Think Python](https://allendowney.github.io/ThinkPython/) and deeply enjoyed the book. However, I would like to adapt the Dr. Downey's excellent book to fit my students' needs following the [Create Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license articulation."

    "\n",
    "Each chapter in this book builds on the previous ones, so you should read them in order and take time to work on the exercises before you move on.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Chapter 1 through 5 introduce basic elements like expressions, operators, data types, conditionals, and loops. They also introduce the most important concept in programming, functions, and a powerful way to use them, recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Chapters 6 and 7 introduce Python's core data structures -- lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets -- which are powerful tools for writing efficient programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Chapters 8 and 9 introduce strings – which can represent letter, words, and sentences – and algorithms for working with them. Chapter 9 presents algorithms for analyzing text and randomly generating new text. Algorithms like these are at the core of large language models (LLMs), so this chapter will give you an idea of how tools like ChatGPT work.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Chapters 10 and 11 introduce object-oriented programming (OOP), which is a way to organize programs and the data they work with. Many Python libraries are written in object-oriented style, so these chapters will help you understand their design -- and define your own objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Chapter 12 through 15 are application and advanced topics such as ways to use files for storing data, exception handling, modules and packages, and using data science modules. "

    "For most programming languages, including Python, there are many tools you can use to write and run programs. \n",
    "These tools are called integrated development environments (IDEs).\n",
    "In general, there are two kinds of IDEs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Some work with files that contain code, so they provide tools for editing and running these files.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Others work primarily with notebooks, which are documents that contain text and code.\n",
    "\n",
    "For beginners, I recommend starting with a notebook development environment like Jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebooks for this book are available from an online repository at <https://allendowney.github.io/ThinkPython>.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to use them:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can download the notebooks and run them on your own computer. In that case, you have to install Python and Jupyter, which is not hard, but if you want to learn Python, it can be frustrating to spend a lot of time installing software.\n",
    "\n",
    "* An alternative is to run the notebooks on Colab, which is a Jupyter environment that runs in a web browser, so you don't have to install anything. Colab is operated by Google, and it is free to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are just getting started, I strongly recommend you start with Colab."
