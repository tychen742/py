    "This is a set of lecture notes (the \"book\" or \"site\") for the Python components of a 5000-level course at Missouri S&T. I have used Allen Downey's [Think Python](https://allendowney.github.io/ThinkPython/) and deeply enjoyed the book. However, I would like to adapt the Dr. Downey's excellent book to fit my students' needs following the [Create Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license articulation."

    "## Navigating the Book\n",
    "\n",
    "Each chapter in this book builds on the previous ones, so you should read them in order and take time to work on the exercises before you move on.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first six chapters introduce basic elements like arithmetic, conditionals, and loops.\n",
    "They also introduce the most important concept in programming, functions, and a powerful way to use them, recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Chapters 7 and 8 introduce strings -- which can represent letter, words, and sentences -- and algorithms for working with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Chapters 9 through 12 introduce Python's core data structures -- lists, dictionaries, and tuples -- which are powerful tools for writing efficient programs.\n",
    "Chapter 12 presents algorithms for analyzing text and randomly generating new text.\n",
    "Algorithms like these are at the core of large language models (LLMs), so this chapter will give you an idea of how tools like ChatGPT work.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Chapter 13 is about ways to store data in long-term storage -- files and databases.\n",
    "As an exercise, you can write a program that searches a file system and finds duplicate files.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Chapters 14 through 17 introduce object-oriented programming (OOP), which is a way to organize programs and the data they work with.\n",
    "Many Python libraries are written in object-oriented style, so these chapters will help you understand their design -- and define your own objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this book is not to cover the entire Python language.\n",
    "Rather, the focus is on a subset of the language that provides the greatest capability with the fewest concepts.\n",
    "Nevertheless, Python has a lot of features you can use to solve common problems efficiently.\n",
    "Chapter 18 presents some of these features.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- Finally, Chapter 19 presents my parting thoughts and suggestions for continuing your programming journey. -->"

    "## Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "For most programming languages, including Python, there are many tools you can use to write and run programs. \n",
    "These tools are called integrated development environments (IDEs).\n",
    "In general, there are two kinds of IDEs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Some work with files that contain code, so they provide tools for editing and running these files.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Others work primarily with notebooks, which are documents that contain text and code.\n",
    "\n",
    "For beginners, I recommend starting with a notebook development environment like Jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebooks for this book are available from an online repository at <https://allendowney.github.io/ThinkPython>.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to use them:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can download the notebooks and run them on your own computer. In that case, you have to install Python and Jupyter, which is not hard, but if you want to learn Python, it can be frustrating to spend a lot of time installing software.\n",
    "\n",
    "* An alternative is to run the notebooks on Colab, which is a Jupyter environment that runs in a web browser, so you don't have to install anything. Colab is operated by Google, and it is free to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are just getting started, I strongly recommend you start with Colab."
