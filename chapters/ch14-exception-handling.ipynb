    "# Chapter 14: Debugging and Exception Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs inevitably encounter errors during development and execution. This chapter teaches you two essential skills: debugging (finding and fixing errors) and exception handling (gracefully managing runtime errors). Together, these skills enable you to write robust programs and efficiently solve problems when they arise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Debugging Skills**\n",
    "- **Understand Error Types**: Distinguish between syntax, runtime, and semantic errors\n",
    "- **Read Tracebacks**: Interpret error messages and stack traces to locate problems\n",
    "- **Debug Effectively**: Use systematic debugging strategies to find and fix errors\n",
    "- **Apply Debugging Techniques**: Use print statements, assertions, and systematic approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Unit Testing for Quality Assurance**\n",
    "- **Write Unit Tests**: Create automated tests to prevent bugs and verify code behavior\n",
    "- **Test-Driven Debugging**: Use tests to isolate problems and guide debugging efforts\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Exception Handling**\n",
    "- **Understand Exceptions**: Recognize when and why exceptions occur during execution\n",
    "- **Try/Except Blocks**: Use try/except statements to handle exceptions gracefully\n",
    "- **Exception Types**: Work with built-in exception types and understand the exception hierarchy\n",
    "- **Multiple Exception Handling**: Handle different types of exceptions with specific responses\n",
    "- **Finally and Else**: Use finally blocks for cleanup and else blocks for success cases\n",
    "- **Raising Exceptions**: Create and raise custom exceptions when needed\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Professional Development Practices**\n",
    "- **Best Practices**: Write defensive code and apply debugging methodologies\n",
    "\n",
    "Mastering debugging, testing, and exception handling is crucial for writing professional, reliable Python applications."

    "### Debugging Philosophy and Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging can be frustrating, but it is also challenging, interesting, and sometimes even fun. It is one of the most important skills you can learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Debugging is like detective work**: You are given clues, and you have to infer the events that led to the results you see.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Debugging is like experimental science**: Once you have an idea about what is going wrong, you modify your program and try again. If your hypothesis was correct, you can predict the result of the modification. If your hypothesis was wrong, you have to come up with a new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key debugging principles:**\n",
    "- Start with a working program and make small modifications\n",
    "- Test frequently - don't write too much code before testing\n",
    "- Use print statements to trace execution\n",
    "- Read error messages carefully\n",
    "- Think systematically about what could be wrong\n",
    "\n",
    "**Debugging mindset:**\n",
    "- **Detective work**: You are given clues, and you have to infer the events that led to the results you see\n",
    "- **Experimental science**: Form hypotheses about what's wrong, test them, and refine your understanding\n",
    "- **Iterative process**: Start with working code and make small modifications, debugging as you go\n",
    "\n",
    "If you find yourself spending a lot of time debugging, that's often a sign you're writing too much code before testing. Taking smaller steps can help you move more quickly.\n",

    "### Understanding Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "When you write programs, things will go wrong. Learning to find and fix these problems is called **debugging**. Before you can handle errors gracefully, you need to understand what types of errors exist and how to find them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of Errors:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Error Type | When It Occurs | Example |\n",
    "|------------|----------------|---------|\n",
    "| **Syntax Error** | Code violates Python grammar | Missing colon, unmatched quotes |\n",
    "| **Runtime Error (Exceptions)** | Error during execution | Division by zero, file not found |\n",
    "| **Logic (Semantic) Error** | Code runs but produces wrong results | Incorrect algorithm, wrong formula |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Runtime Exception Types:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ZeroDivisionError`: Division by zero\n",
    "- `NameError`: Using undefined variable  \n",
    "- `TypeError`: Wrong data type for operation\n",
    "- `ValueError`: Correct type but invalid value\n",
    "- `IndexError`: List index out of range\n",
    "- `KeyError`: Dictionary key not found\n",
    "- `FileNotFoundError`: File doesn't exist\n",
    "- `ImportError`: Module cannot be imported\n",

    "When Python encounters a runtime error, it displays a **traceback** - an error report that shows where the error occurred. Learning to read tracebacks is essential for debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "The error message includes a **traceback**, which shows:\n",
    "1. **Where** the error occurred  \n",

    "3. What **type of error** happened\n",
    "\n",
    "The order of functions in the traceback matches the order of function calls: you read it from **bottom to top**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bottom**: The error type and message (e.g., \"NameError: name 'cat' is not defined\")\n",
    "- **Middle**: The line where the error actually happened  \n",

    "2. If no exception occurs, the `except` block is skipped\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Be Specific**: Catch specific exception types rather than generic exceptions\n",
    "2. **Don't Ignore**: Always handle or log exceptions properly\n",
    "3. **Clean Up**: Use finally blocks for resource management\n",
    "4. **Meaningful Messages**: Provide clear, actionable error messages\n",
    "5. **Appropriate Use**: Don't use exceptions for normal control flow\n",
