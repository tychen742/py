In this chapter, you’ll get a high-level view of what programming is, how Python fits into the broader computing landscape, and the key ideas you’ll rely on throughout the book. You’ll also be guided through setting up your working environment—using the command line interface (CLI) and Jupyter Notebooks (detailed in the appendices)—so that you can write, run, and experiment with Python code effectively."
