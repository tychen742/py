    "\n",
    "Python was created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s and first released publicly in 1991. It was designed to emphasize readability and a clean, expressive syntax. The language is open source and guided by the Python Software Foundation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key milestones**\n",
    "- 1991: First public release (Python 0.9.0).\n",
    "- 2000: Python 2.0 introduces list comprehensions and garbage collection.\n",
    "- 2008: Python 3.0 releases with backward-incompatible cleanups (e.g., print as a function).\n",
    "- 2020: Python 2 reaches end of life; Python 3 becomes the standard.\n"
