    "## Programming Language\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning to program means learning a new way of thinking -- thinking like a computer scientist. This approach combines some of the best features of mathematics, engineering, and the natural sciences. Like mathematicians, computer scientists use formal languages to denote ideas -- specifically computations. Like engineers, they design things, assembling components into systems and evaluating trade-offs among alternatives. Like scientists, they observe the behavior of complex systems, form hypotheses, and test predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Natural vs Formal Languages\n",
    "**Natural languages** are the languages that people use to communicate, such as English, Spanish, and French. They were not designed by people; they evolved naturally. **Formal languages** are languages that are designed by people for specific applications. For example, the notation that mathematicians use is a formal language that is particularly good at denoting relationships among numbers and symbols. Similarly, programming languages are formal languages designed to express computations. Although formal and natural languages have some features in common, there are important differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ambiguity: Natural languages are full of ambiguity, which people deal with by using contextual clues and other information. Formal languages are designed to be nearly or completely unambiguous, which means that any program has exactly one meaning, regardless of context.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Redundancy: In order to make up for ambiguity and reduce misunderstandings, natural languages use redundancy. As a result, they are often verbose. Formal languages are less redundant and more concise.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Literalness: Natural languages are full of idiom and metaphor. Formal languages mean exactly what they say.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we all grow up speaking natural languages, it is sometimes hard to adjust to formal languages. Formal languages are **denser** than natural languages, so it takes longer to read them. Additionally, the **structure** is important, so it is not always best to read from top to bottom or left to right. Finally, the **details** matter. Small errors in spelling and punctuation, which you can get away with in natural languages, can make a big difference in a formal language."

    "Programming languages also differ in how they are executed. In the old days, **Interpreted languages** (like Python, JavaScript, and Ruby) were executed line by line by an interpreter at runtime, which translated and ran the code on the fly. **Compiled languages** (such as C, C++, and Rust), on the other hand, require a compilation step in which the entire source code is translated into machine code before execution, resulting in faster runtime performance. Modern time languages (like Python, Java, and C#) use a hybrid approach, compiling code to an intermediate **bytecode** that is then interpreted or just-in-time compiled by a virtual machine, combining the benefits of both models."

    "For computers, the smallest unit of data is a **bit** (Binary Digit). A bit can only be 0 or 1, which can represent off/on, false/true, or no voltage/voltage. A **byte**, on the other hand, is a group of 8 bits, which can represent 2^8, which is 256, different values (0-255), and is the fundamental addressable unit in modern computing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Computers only process machine code. For humans to talk to computers, we need something in between that's understood by both, and that is encoding. For example, letter **A** is represented as 65 (base 10) or 0b1000001 in the ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) code table. ASCII encoding covers English characters (including special characters, numbers, and the alphabet). An early version of the ASCII table is the MIL-STD-188-100:\n",

    "In this chart, you can see that letter **A** is of binary bits `1000 001`. When comparing string/character literals, we say that 'B' is greater than 'B' because of the encoding (the ASCII value of 'B' is 66, which is greater than the ASCII value of 'B', 65). \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the ASCII code only represents English characters, the [Unicode Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) and the standard Unicode Transformation Format (UTF) schemes were proposed to support the use of text in all of the world's writing systems that can be digitized; among them, [**UTF-8**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8, which is the dominant encoding system for all languages on the internet, and is supported by all modern operating systems and programming languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "ASCII uses 1 byte (7 bits originally and 8 bits for extended ASCII) to represent each character for its standard 128 characters, while UTF-8 is variable-length, using 1 to 4 byte code units (8 to 32 bits) to support 1,112,064 code points, while also encoding standard ASCII characters in just 1 byte for backwards-compatibility. With the large number of code points supported, UTF-8 is able to represent emojis and East Asian language characters."
