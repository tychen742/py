    "This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of programming using Python as our teaching language. Understanding these core concepts is essential for any programmer, as they form the foundation upon which all programming skills are built.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Essential Topics Covered\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you will learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Programming Language**: How formal languages differ from natural languages and where Python sits along the abstraction spectrum\n",
    "2. **Expressions and Statements**: How Python evaluates expressions and executes statements to drive every computation\n",
    "3. **Python Keywords**: Reserved words (including new soft keywords) that define Python's syntax and structure\n",
    "4. **Variables**: Naming rules, assignment semantics, and the lifecycle of data stored in memory\n",
    "5. **Built-in Data Types**: Numbers, sequences, mappings, sets, and best practices for choosing the right container\n",
    "6. **Operators**: Arithmetic, comparison, logical, and bitwise operators along with precedence rules\n",
    "7. **Built-in Functions**: Ready-made helpers such as len(), type(), sum(), plus when to lean on the math and operator modules\n",
    "8. **Functions (User-Defined)**: Designing reusable behavior with parameters, return values, and docstrings\n",
    "9. **Modules and Packages**: Importing standard-library modules, organizing your own code, and managing dependencies\n",
    "10. **Number Systems**: Translating information across binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal bases\n",
    "11. **Resources**: Curated documentation, reference guides, and recommended next steps\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** For debugging and error handling, see Chapter 14 on Exception Handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "These concepts are universal across most programming languages, though the syntax and specific implementations may differ. Mastering them in Python will give you a solid foundation for learning other languages and tackling more advanced programming challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin by understanding what programming languages are and why they exist."

    "## Programming Language\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning to program means learning a new way of thinking -- thinking like a computer scientist. This approach combines some of the best features of mathematics, engineering, and the natural sciences. Like mathematicians, computer scientists use formal languages to denote ideas -- specifically computations. Like engineers, they design things, assembling components into systems and evaluating trade-offs among alternatives. Like scientists, they observe the behavior of complex systems, form hypotheses, and test predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Natural languages** are the languages that people use to communicate, such as English, Spanish, and French. They were not designed by people; they evolved naturally. **Formal languages** are languages that are designed by people for specific applications. For example, the notation that mathematicians use is a formal language that is particularly good at denoting relationships among numbers and symbols. Similarly, programming languages are formal languages designed to express computations. Although formal and natural languages have some features in common, there are important differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ambiguity: Natural languages are full of ambiguity, which people deal with by using contextual clues and other information. Formal languages are designed to be nearly or completely unambiguous, which means that any program has exactly one meaning, regardless of context.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Redundancy: In order to make up for ambiguity and reduce misunderstandings, natural languages use redundancy. As a result, they are often verbose. Formal languages are less redundant and more concise.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Literalness: Natural languages are full of idiom and metaphor. Formal languages mean exactly what they say.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming languages exist on a spectrum, ranging from those closest to hardware (machine code) to those closest to high-level languages that are more human-readable, as shown below: \n",
    "\n",
    "| Level | Description | Examples | Code Example |\n",
    "|-------|-------------|----------|--------------|\n",
    "| **High-Level Languages** | Closest to human language, abstracted from hardware details | Python, Java, JavaScript, C, C++ | `print(\"Hello, World!\")` |\n",
    "| **Low-Level Languages** | Closer to machine code, direct hardware manipulation | Assembly language | `mov eax, 1`<br>`msg db 'Hello, World!', 0xA` |\n",
    "| **Machine Code** | Binary instructions directly executed by CPU | Binary (0s and 1s) | `10110000 00000000`<br>`10110001 00001010` |\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we all grow up speaking natural languages, it is sometimes hard to adjust to formal languages. Formal languages are **denser** than natural languages, so it takes longer to read them. Additionally, the **structure** is important, so it is not always best to read from top to bottom or left to right. Finally, the **details** matter. Small errors in spelling and punctuation, which you can get away with in natural languages, can make a big difference in a formal language.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you will learn the **vocabulary of programming**, including terms such as **operator**, **expression**, **value**, **type**, **function**, and **module**. This vocabulary is important: you will need it to understand materials in computation, to design solutions to computational problems, and to communicate effectively with other programmers."

    "### Key Programming Constructs\n",
    "\n",
    "A computer program is a set of instructions (written in the specific notations specified by a programming language) given to computers. Interestingly, there are only a small number of key concepts that we need to know when learning how to give instructions to computers, applicable to most programming languages. These basic control structure constructs include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sequence**: instructions are executed one after another (sequential execution).\n",
    "2. **Selection**: decision-making/control structure; namely, choosing between alternative paths of actions within a program.\n",
    "3. **Iteration**: code repetition; either count-controlled or condition-controlled.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the three basic programming constructs are constructs such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Subroutine**: blocks of code (**function**/**method**) in a modular program performing a particular task.\n",
    "2. **Nesting**: Selection and iteration constructs can be nested within each other.\n",
    "3. **Variable**: a named computer memory location that stores values\n",
    "4. Data type (**Type**): a classification of data values specifying the values and operations on the values.\n",
    "5. **Operator**: symbols that perform operations on one or more operands.\n",
    "6. **Array**: storing multiple values of the same data type in a single variable, aka, data **collections**."

    "### Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comments** are explanatory notes in your code that are ignored by the Python interpreter. Comments are used to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Explain complex logic: Help others (and your future self) understand what the code does\n",
    "2. Document assumptions: Note why certain decisions were made\n",
    "3. Mark **TODO** items: Indicate areas that need improvement or completion\n",
    "4. **Disable code temporarily**: Comment out code for testing without deleting it\n",
    "\n",
    "Single-line comments start with the hash symbol `#`. Everything after `#` on that line is ignored by Python. For multi-line comments, we use multiple hashes or triple quotes. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "### 1. Single-line comment\n",
    "# This is a single-line comment\n",
    "x = 5  # This comment explains the variable\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Multi-Line Comments\n",
    "For longer comments, you can use multiple single-line comments or a multi-line assigned string. \n",
    "# line 1\n",
    "# line 2\n",
    "# line 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, good variable names can reduce the need for comments, but long names can make complex expressions hard to read, so there is a tradeoff. For example, `velocity_mph = 8` might be clear without a comment, but `v = 8 # velocity in miles per hour` might be more readable in a mathematical formula."

    "## Functions (User-Defined)\n",
    "\n",
    "While Python's built-in functions are useful, the real power of programming comes from creating your own **functions**. A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Functions help you organize code, avoid repetition, and make programs easier to understand and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reusability**: Write code once, use it many times\n",
    "2. **Organization**: Break complex problems into smaller pieces\n",
    "3. **Readability**: Give meaningful names to chunks of code\n",
    "4. **Maintenance**: Fix bugs in one place rather than many\n",
    "5. **Testing**: Test individual pieces of functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the `def` keyword to define a function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def function_name(parameters):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Docstring describing what the function does.\"\"\"\n",
    "    # Function body\n",
    "    return value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key components:**\n",
    "- **`def`**: Keyword that starts a function definition\n",
    "- **Function name**: Follows variable naming rules (snake_case)\n",
    "- **Parameters**: Input values (optional)\n",
    "- **Docstring**: Documentation string (recommended)\n",
    "- **Function body**: Indented code that runs when function is called\n",
    "- **`return`**: Sends a value back to the caller (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Function Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet():\n",
    "    \"\"\"Print a greeting message.\"\"\"\n",
    "    print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Call the function\n",
    "greet()  # Output: Hello, World!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions with Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters allow functions to work with different inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet_person(name):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Greet a person by name.\"\"\"\n",
    "    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "greet_person(\"Alice\")  # Output: Hello, Alice!\n",
    "greet_person(\"Bob\")    # Output: Hello, Bob!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions with Multiple Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add_numbers(a, b):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Add two numbers and return the result.\"\"\"\n",
    "    result = a + b\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "\n",
    "sum1 = add_numbers(5, 3)      # Returns 8\n",
    "sum2 = add_numbers(10, 20)    # Returns 30\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions with Return Values\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can return values using the `return` statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def calculate_area(length, width):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Calculate the area of a rectangle.\"\"\"\n",
    "    area = length * width\n",
    "    return area\n",
    "\n",
    "rect_area = calculate_area(5, 3)\n",
    "print(f\"Area: {rect_area}\")  # Output: Area: 15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:**\n",
    "- A function without `return` returns `None`\n",
    "- You can return multiple values: `return x, y, z`\n",
    "- `return` immediately exits the function\n",
    "\n",
    "### Default Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters can have default values:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet(name, greeting=\"Hello\"):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Greet with a customizable greeting.\"\"\"\n",
    "    return f\"{greeting}, {name}!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(greet(\"Alice\"))              # Hello, Alice!\n",
    "print(greet(\"Bob\", \"Hi\"))          # Hi, Bob!\n",
    "print(greet(\"Charlie\", \"Hey\"))     # Hey, Charlie!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables created inside functions are **local** to that function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_function():\n",
    "    local_var = 10  # Only exists inside function\n",
    "    print(local_var)\n",
    "\n",
    "my_function()     # Prints: 10\n",
    "# print(local_var)  # Error: local_var doesn't exist here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables outside functions are **global**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "global_var = 100  # Accessible everywhere\n",
    "\n",
    "def show_global():\n",
    "    print(global_var)  # Can read global variable\n",
    "\n",
    "show_global()  # Prints: 100\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Documenting Functions with Docstrings\n",
    "\n",
    "Always document your functions with docstrings:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def calculate_bmi(weight, height):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Calculate Body Mass Index (BMI).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Args:\n",
    "        weight: Weight in kilograms (float)\n",
    "        height: Height in meters (float)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Returns:\n",
    "        BMI value (float)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "        >>> calculate_bmi(70, 1.75)\n",
    "        22.86\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    return weight / (height ** 2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Good docstrings include:\n",
    "- What the function does\n",
    "- Parameters and their types\n",
    "- What the function returns\n",
    "- Usage examples (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **One task per function**: Each function should do one thing well\n",
    "2. **Meaningful names**: Use descriptive function names\n",
    "3. **Keep functions short**: Ideally under 20 lines\n",
    "4. **Use docstrings**: Document what your function does\n",
    "5. **Avoid side effects**: Functions should be predictable\n",
    "6. **Return values**: Use `return` instead of `print` for output\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function that validates input:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def is_valid_age(age):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Check if age is valid (0-120).\"\"\"\n",
    "    return 0 <= age <= 120\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function that processes data:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def convert_to_uppercase(text):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Convert text to uppercase.\"\"\"\n",
    "    return text.upper()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function that calculates:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def calculate_discount(price, percentage):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Calculate price after discount.\"\"\"\n",
    "    discount = price * (percentage / 100)\n",
    "    return price - discount\n",
    "```"

    "## Modules and Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "A **module** is a collection of variables and functions. Built-in modules are part of the Python Standard Library, but unlike the built-in **functions**, you must **import** them before use. They provide additional features, including math, date functions, OS access, file utilities, and random number generation, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **package** is a collection of modules organized in a directory hierarchy. Packages allow you to structure your Python projects into namespaces, making it easier to organize related modules together. For example, `numpy` is a package that contains many modules for numerical computing, and you can import specific modules from it using dot notation like `from numpy import array`. Packages typically contain a special `__init__.py` file that marks the directory as a Python package, though in modern Python (3.3+) this is optional for implicit namespace packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "While the Python Standard Library comes with many built-in modules, you can extend Python's capabilities by installing third-party packages using **pip** (Python's package installer). To install a package, you use the command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install package_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to install the popular data science package `numpy`:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install numpy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once installed, you can import and use the package in your Python code just like built-in modules. In Jupyter Notebooks, you can also install packages directly in a code cell using the `%pip` magic command:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "%pip install numpy\n",
    "```"
