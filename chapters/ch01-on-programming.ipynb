    "## Programming Language\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning to program means learning a new way of thinking -- thinking like a computer scientist. This approach combines some of the best features of mathematics, engineering, and the natural sciences. Like mathematicians, computer scientists use formal languages to denote ideas -- specifically computations. Like engineers, they design things, assembling components into systems and evaluating trade-offs among alternatives. Like scientists, they observe the behavior of complex systems, form hypotheses, and test predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Natural vs Formal Languages\n",
    "**Natural languages** are the languages that people use to communicate, such as English, Spanish, and French. They were not designed by people; they evolved naturally. **Formal languages** are languages that are designed by people for specific applications. For example, the notation that mathematicians use is a formal language that is particularly good at denoting relationships among numbers and symbols. Similarly, programming languages are formal languages designed to express computations. Although formal and natural languages have some features in common, there are important differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ambiguity: Natural languages are full of ambiguity, which people deal with by using contextual clues and other information. Formal languages are designed to be nearly or completely unambiguous, which means that any program has exactly one meaning, regardless of context.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Redundancy: In order to make up for ambiguity and reduce misunderstandings, natural languages use redundancy. As a result, they are often verbose. Formal languages are less redundant and more concise.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Literalness: Natural languages are full of idiom and metaphor. Formal languages mean exactly what they say.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we all grow up speaking natural languages, it is sometimes hard to adjust to formal languages. Formal languages are **denser** than natural languages, so it takes longer to read them. Additionally, the **structure** is important, so it is not always best to read from top to bottom or left to right. Finally, the **details** matter. Small errors in spelling and punctuation, which you can get away with in natural languages, can make a big difference in a formal language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Levels of abstraction\n",
    "Programming languages exist on a spectrum, ranging from those closest to hardware (machine code) to those closest to high-level languages that are more human-readable, as shown below: \n",
    "\n",
    "| Level | Description | Examples | Code Example |\n",
    "|-------|-------------|----------|--------------|\n",
    "| **High-Level Languages** | Closest to human language, abstracted from hardware details | Python, Java, JavaScript, C, C++ | `print(\"Hello, World!\")` |\n",
    "| **Low-Level Languages** | Closer to machine code, direct hardware manipulation | Assembly language | `mov eax, 1`<br>`msg db 'Hello, World!', 0xA` |\n",
    "| **Machine Code** | Binary instructions directly executed by CPU | Binary (0s and 1s) | `10110000 00000000`<br>`10110001 00001010` |"

    "### Interpreted vs. Compiled \n",
    "\n",
    "Programming languages also differ in how they are executed. In the old times, **Interpreted languages** (like Python, JavaScript, and Ruby) are executed line-by-line by an interpreter at runtime, which translates and runs the code on the fly. **Compiled languages** (like C, C++, and Rust), on the other hand, require a compilation step where the entire source code is translated into machine code before execution, resulting in faster runtime performance. Modern time languages (like Python, Java, and C#) use a hybrid approach, compiling code to an intermediate **bytecode** that is then interpreted or just-in-time compiled by a virtual machine, combining benefits of both models."

    "A computer program is a set of instructions (written in the specific notations specified by a programming language) given to computers.

These basic control structure constructs include:\n",

    "1. **Sequence**: instructions are executed one after another (sequential execution).\n",
    "2. **Selection**: decision-making/control structure; namely, choosing between alternative paths of actions within a program.\n",
    "3. **Iteration**: code repetition; either count-controlled or condition-controlled.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the three basic programming constructs, programming languages have construct elements such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Subroutine**: blocks of code (**function**/**method**) in a modular program performing a particular task.\n",
    "2. **Nesting**: Selection and iteration constructs can be nested within each other.\n",
    "3. **Variable**: a named computer memory location that stores values\n",
    "4. Data type (**Type**): a classification of data values specifying the values and operations on the values.\n",
    "5. **Operator**: symbols that perform operations on one or more operands.\n",

    "## Functions (User-Defined)\n",
    "\n",
    "While Python's built-in functions are useful, the real power of programming comes from creating your own **functions**. A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Functions help you organize code, avoid repetition, and make programs easier to understand and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reusability**: Write code once, use it many times\n",
    "2. **Organization**: Break complex problems into smaller pieces\n",
    "3. **Readability**: Give meaningful names to chunks of code\n",
    "4. **Maintenance**: Fix bugs in one place rather than many\n",
    "5. **Testing**: Test individual pieces of functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the `def` keyword to define a function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def function_name(parameters):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Docstring describing what the function does.\"\"\"\n",
    "    # Function body\n",
    "    return value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key components:**\n",
    "- **`def`**: Keyword that starts a function definition\n",
    "- **Function name**: Follows variable naming rules (snake_case)\n",
    "- **Parameters**: Input values (optional)\n",
    "- **Docstring**: Documentation string (recommended)\n",
    "- **Function body**: Indented code that runs when function is called\n",
    "- **`return`**: Sends a value back to the caller (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Function Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet():\n",
    "    \"\"\"Print a greeting message.\"\"\"\n",
    "    print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Call the function\n",
    "greet()  # Output: Hello, World!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions with Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters allow functions to work with different inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet_person(name):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Greet a person by name.\"\"\"\n",
    "    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "greet_person(\"Alice\")  # Output: Hello, Alice!\n",
    "greet_person(\"Bob\")    # Output: Hello, Bob!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions with Multiple Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add_numbers(a, b):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Add two numbers and return the result.\"\"\"\n",
    "    result = a + b\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "\n",
    "sum1 = add_numbers(5, 3)      # Returns 8\n",
    "sum2 = add_numbers(10, 20)    # Returns 30\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions with Return Values\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can return values using the `return` statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def calculate_area(length, width):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Calculate the area of a rectangle.\"\"\"\n",
    "    area = length * width\n",
    "    return area\n",
    "\n",
    "rect_area = calculate_area(5, 3)\n",
    "print(f\"Area: {rect_area}\")  # Output: Area: 15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:**\n",
    "- A function without `return` returns `None`\n",
    "- You can return multiple values: `return x, y, z`\n",
    "- `return` immediately exits the function\n",
    "\n",
    "### Default Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters can have default values:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet(name, greeting=\"Hello\"):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Greet with a customizable greeting.\"\"\"\n",
    "    return f\"{greeting}, {name}!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(greet(\"Alice\"))              # Hello, Alice!\n",
    "print(greet(\"Bob\", \"Hi\"))          # Hi, Bob!\n",
    "print(greet(\"Charlie\", \"Hey\"))     # Hey, Charlie!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables created inside functions are **local** to that function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_function():\n",
    "    local_var = 10  # Only exists inside function\n",
    "    print(local_var)\n",
    "\n",
    "my_function()     # Prints: 10\n",
    "# print(local_var)  # Error: local_var doesn't exist here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables outside functions are **global**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "global_var = 100  # Accessible everywhere\n",
    "\n",
    "def show_global():\n",
    "    print(global_var)  # Can read global variable\n",
    "\n",
    "show_global()  # Prints: 100\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Documenting Functions with Docstrings\n",
    "\n",
    "Always document your functions with docstrings:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def calculate_bmi(weight, height):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Calculate Body Mass Index (BMI).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Args:\n",
    "        weight: Weight in kilograms (float)\n",
    "        height: Height in meters (float)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Returns:\n",
    "        BMI value (float)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "        >>> calculate_bmi(70, 1.75)\n",
    "        22.86\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    return weight / (height ** 2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Good docstrings include:\n",
    "- What the function does\n",
    "- Parameters and their types\n",
    "- What the function returns\n",
    "- Usage examples (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **One task per function**: Each function should do one thing well\n",
    "2. **Meaningful names**: Use descriptive function names\n",
    "3. **Keep functions short**: Ideally under 20 lines\n",
    "4. **Use docstrings**: Document what your function does\n",
    "5. **Avoid side effects**: Functions should be predictable\n",
    "6. **Return values**: Use `return` instead of `print` for output\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function that validates input:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def is_valid_age(age):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Check if age is valid (0-120).\"\"\"\n",
    "    return 0 <= age <= 120\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function that processes data:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def convert_to_uppercase(text):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Convert text to uppercase.\"\"\"\n",
    "    return text.upper()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function that calculates:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def calculate_discount(price, percentage):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Calculate price after discount.\"\"\"\n",
    "    discount = price * (percentage / 100)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions with Return Values\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can return values using the `return` statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def calculate_area(length, width):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Calculate the area of a rectangle.\"\"\"\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:**\n",
    "- A function without `return` returns `None`\n",
    "- You can return multiple values: `return x, y, z`\n",
    "- `return` immediately exits the function\n",
    "\n",
    "### Default Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters can have default values:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet(name, greeting=\"Hello\"):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Greet with a customizable greeting.\"\"\"\n",
    "    return f\"{greeting}, {name}!\"\n",

    "print(greet(\"Charlie\", \"Hey\"))     # Hey, Charlie!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables created inside functions are **local** to that function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_function():\n",
    "    local_var = 10  # Only exists inside function\n",
    "    print(local_var)\n",
    "\n",
    "my_function()     # Prints: 10\n",
    "# print(local_var)  # Error: local_var doesn't exist here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables outside functions are **global**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "global_var = 100  # Accessible everywhere\n",
    "\n",
    "def show_global():\n",
    "    print(global_var)  # Can read global variable\n",
    "\n",
    "show_global()  # Prints: 100\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Documenting Functions with Docstrings\n",
    "\n",
    "Always document your functions with docstrings:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def calculate_bmi(weight, height):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Calculate Body Mass Index (BMI).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Args:\n",
    "        weight: Weight in kilograms (float)\n",
    "        height: Height in meters (float)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Returns:\n",
    "        BMI value (float)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "        >>> calculate_bmi(70, 1.75)\n",
    "        22.86\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    return weight / (height ** 2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Good docstrings include:\n",
    "- What the function does\n",
    "- Parameters and their types\n",
    "- What the function returns\n",
    "- Usage examples (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **One task per function**: Each function should do one thing well\n",
    "2. **Meaningful names**: Use descriptive function names\n",
    "3. **Keep functions short**: Ideally under 20 lines\n",
    "4. **Use docstrings**: Document what your function does\n",
    "5. **Avoid side effects**: Functions should be predictable\n",
    "6. **Return values**: Use `return` instead of `print` for output\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function that validates input:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def is_valid_age(age):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Check if age is valid (0-120).\"\"\"\n",
    "    return 0 <= age <= 120\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function that processes data:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def convert_to_uppercase(text):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Convert text to uppercase.\"\"\"\n",
    "    return text.upper()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function that calculates:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def calculate_discount(price, percentage):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Calculate price after discount.\"\"\"\n",
    "    discount = price * (percentage / 100)\n",

A **byte**, on the other hand, is a group of 8 bits, which can represent 2^8, which is 256, different values (0-255), and is the fundamental addressable unit in modern computing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Computers only process machine code. For humans to talk to computers, we need something in between that's understood by both, and that is encoding. For example, letter **A** is represented as 65 (base 10) or 0b1000001 in the ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) code table. ASCII encoding covers English characters (including special characters, numbers, and the alphabet). An early version of the ASCII table is the MIL-STD-188-100:\n",

    "Since the ASCII code only represents English characters, the [Unicode Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) and the standard Unicode Transformation Format (UTF) schemes were proposed to support the use of text in all of the world's writing systems that can be digitized; among them, [**UTF-8**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8, which is the dominant encoding system for all languages on the internet, and is supported by all modern operating systems and programming languages. \n",

With the large number of code points supported, UTF-8 is able to represent emojis and East Asian language characters."

    "## Exception Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing programs, errors are inevitable. Python distinguishes between **syntax errors** (code that violates Python grammar rules) and **exceptions** (errors detected during execution). Exception handling allows your program to respond gracefully to runtime errors instead of crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Exception Handling Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Without exception handling:\n",
    "- Programs **crash** with cryptic error messages\n",
    "- **Users** have poor experience\n",
    "- Difficult to **debug** production issues\n",
    "\n",
    "With exception handling:\n",
    "- Programs can recover from errors\n",
    "- Provide user-friendly error messages\n",
    "- Log errors for debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Exception Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has many built-in exception types. Here are the most common:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Exception | Description | Example |\n",
    "|-----------|-------------|---------|\n",
    "| `ValueError` | Invalid value for operation | `int(\"hello\")` |\n",
    "| `TypeError` | Wrong type for operation | `\"5\" + 5` |\n",
    "| `ZeroDivisionError` | Division by zero | `10 / 0` |\n",
    "| `IndexError` | Index out of range | `[1, 2][5]` |\n",
    "| `KeyError` | Dictionary key not found | `{}[\"missing\"]` |\n",
    "| `FileNotFoundError` | File doesn't exist | `open(\"nonexistent.txt\")` |\n",
    "| `AttributeError` | Attribute doesn't exist | `\"text\".nonexistent()` |\n",
    "| `NameError` | Variable not defined | `print(undefined_var)` |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Exception Handling: `try`-`except`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure:**\n",
    "- **`try`**: Block containing code that might raise an exception\n",
    "- **`except`**: Block to handle specific exception type(s)\n",
    "- **`finally`** (optional): Block that always executes, regardless of exception\n",
    "- **`else`** (optional): Block that executes if no exception occurs"
