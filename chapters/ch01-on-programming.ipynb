    "## Programming Language\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning to program means learning a new way of thinking -- thinking like a computer scientist. This approach combines some of the best features of mathematics, engineering, and the natural sciences. Like mathematicians, computer scientists use formal languages to denote ideas -- specifically computations. Like engineers, they design things, assembling components into systems and evaluating trade-offs among alternatives. Like scientists, they observe the behavior of complex systems, form hypotheses, and test predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Natural languages** are the languages that people use to communicate, such as English, Spanish, and French. They were not designed by people; they evolved naturally. **Formal languages** are languages that are designed by people for specific applications. For example, the notation that mathematicians use is a formal language that is particularly good at denoting relationships among numbers and symbols. Similarly, programming languages are formal languages designed to express computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although formal and natural languages have some features in common, there are important differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ambiguity: Natural languages are full of ambiguity, which people deal with by using contextual clues and other information. Formal languages are designed to be nearly or completely unambiguous, which means that any program has exactly one meaning, regardless of context.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Redundancy: In order to make up for ambiguity and reduce misunderstandings, natural languages use redundancy. As a result, they are often verbose. Formal languages are less redundant and more concise.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Literalness: Natural languages are full of idiom and metaphor. Formal languages mean exactly what they say.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we all grow up speaking natural languages, it is sometimes hard to adjust to formal languages. Formal languages are denser than natural languages, so it takes longer to read them. Also, the structure is important, so it is not always best to read from top to bottom, left to right. Finally, the details matter. Small errors in spelling and punctuation, which you can get away with in natural languages, can make a big difference in a formal language.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start with the most basic elements of programming and work our way up. In this chapter, we'll see how Python represents *numbers*, *letters*, *words*, and *arithmetic operations*. You will also begin to learn the **vocabulary of programming**, including terms such as **operator**, **expression**, **value**, **type**, **function**, and **module**. This vocabulary is important — you will need it to understand materials like this book, to design computational solutions to problems, and to communicate effectively with other programmers."
