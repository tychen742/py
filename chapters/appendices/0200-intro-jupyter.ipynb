    "We will be using Jupyter Notebooks, an interactive environment for writing and running Python, extensively in this course. Jupyter Notebook is a crucial component of the Python ecosystem and is widely used by the data science and machine learning communities for its ability to combine code and notes seamlessly. Alternatively, you can use Google Colab, which is also a Jupyter Notebook. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the Jupyter Notebook system, including instructions on installation, effective usage, and navigation of its environment.\n",

    "Some prefer to use Anaconda to manage Jupyter Notebook. We use the Python package installer ```pip``` for simplicity and better project control. The popular IDE VS Code can also run Jupyter Notebooks, but the user experience differs, and we will use Jupyter Notebooks in this course.\n",

    "The best way to install and configure Jupyter Notebook is to create a Python virtual environment. To do that, we need to use the Command Line Interface (CLI) on the computer. To install and start using Jupyter Notebook, follow the four steps below: \n",
