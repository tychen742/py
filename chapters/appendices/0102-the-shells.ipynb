    "Having some knowledge of using the command line interface (CLI) is necessary when learning how to code. A CLI is often referred to, interchangeably, as the _command prompt_ in Windows, **shell** in Linux/macOS, or **command line** or **terminal** in general. Major operating systems (OSs) all have CLIs for users to interact with the operating system by issuing text commands in the CLI rather than using GUIs for speed, automation, and granular control. (For a discussion on terminology such as terminal, console, and shell, see [here](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/whats-the-difference-between-a-console-a-terminal-and-a-shell).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Different OSs are shipped with different CLIs, which include: \n",
    "- **Terminal** applications (or “terminal emulators” as they emulate the locally-attached dumb terminals) to access the shells and\n",
    "- **Shell** interpreters for the user to issue commands to communicate with the OS.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, terminals are programs like Windows PowerShell/Command Prompt, macOS Terminal.app, or Linux Terminal that you open to access the `shell`. A shell is a command-line **interpreter**. Note that a GUI is also considered a shell as it interfaces with the OS.\n",
    "\n",
    "While a terminal can support multiple shells, each shell performs the same core function of interacting with the operating system. Major OSs and their default or commonly used shells are:\n",
    "\n",
    "| OS | Terminal Emulator | Common Shell |\n",
    "|---------|----------|----------------------------|\n",
    "| Windows | Windows Terminal | PowerShell, Batch (command prompt, CMD) |\n",
    "| macOS   | Terminal | Bash, Zsh              |\n",
    "| Linux distributions |  GNOME, Konsole | Bash |\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, it is also common to refer to the CLI interpreter of a computer programming language as `shell`, such as Python shell for Python or `CSharpRepl` for C#."

    "Unix-like OSs (such as Unix, macOS, and Linux) systems are file-based, meaning the design principle dictates that everything in the system is a file, and the files are organized as a tree-like file system structure following the [Filesystem Hierarchy Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard). In the CLI, a file **path** is then used to access a file or a directory/folder in the computer’s hierarchical file structure in the absence of a GUI. \n",
    "\n",
    "The file system structure begins with the **root** (`/`), which contains several default first-level directories representing various functionalities. For example, one of the first default locations after logging in is the user’s home directory, which is specified as `/home/USER_NAME`. A typical Unix-like system would have a system directory structure similar to {numref}`linux_directory_tree`. Note that in {numref}`linux_directory_tree`, there is a number of first-level directories under the root directory, and there are two user directories (\"bill\" and \"patrick\") under the home directory, where all user accounts are created under.

To access the Python shell, you can start your terminal (PowerShell in Windows Terminal or Terminal in macOS) and type `python` or `python3` with Enter.
