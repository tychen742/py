    "## Creating Project Directory\n",
    "In general, when we create a project, it means we are creating a folder/directory. To use a project directory, we use the command line interface (CLI) of your OS. Since they are CLI rather than a graphical user interface (GUI), we need to use commands to create folders and navigate the paths. Although this can be done with a GUI file manager, knowing how to use the CLI is a good skill set to have in the long run. The three shell commands that we use here are: \n",
    "- `ls` (\"list storage\"),\n",
    "- `mkdir` (\"make directory\"), and\n",
    "- `cd` (\"change directory\").\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of clarity, we want to create a `workspace` directory within your user's home directory, and a `dsm` directory within the `workspace` directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that macOS and Linux use forward slashes for directory separators, while Windows uses backward slashes as separators (Windows can also interpret forward slashes).\n",

    "## Installing Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **dsm** project directory, we will create a Python virtual environment for the project. This means that we will place all installed packages (dependencies) that we use in the `site-packages` directory of the virtual environment rather than installing them in the system Python, which is prone to conflicts when different versions of software packages are installed or upgraded. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, installing the packages in the project virtual environment also means that we are making this environment portable, meaning we can replicate the dependencies in another project or device. Note that, in addition to the installed project, the virtual environment also contains a link to the desired Python version. \n",
    "\n",
    "To create the virtual environment for the project, we issue the command as `python -m venv .venv`, in which `python` is the default desired version of Python, `-m` means module, `venv` is the module that creates virtual environment, and `.venv`, as a convention, is the name of the project virtual environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for creating a Python virtual environment is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m venv <environment_path_and_name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we want to control which version of Python to use (3.12 in this case), we will use the version suffix by issuing `py -3.12 -m venv .venv` (Windows) or `python3.12 -m venv .venv` (macOS) to specify the Python version to use (which may be different from the system default Python version): \n",
