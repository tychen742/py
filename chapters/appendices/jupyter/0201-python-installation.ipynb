    "In this course, we will use **Python 3.12.2** because we want to utilize an autograder in Jupyter Notebook to provide you with instant feedback on your answers to some of the questions. It is very common for an OS, Windows or otherwise, to have multiple Python installations, so you may install different versions of Python on your computer. Python 3.13, for example, allows you to exit the Python shell using `exit` instead of `exit()`, which you may prefer when not working on DSM. \n"

    "- **Terminal**: Terminals are programs that you open to access the `shell`. Common terminal programs include Windows PowerShell/Command Prompt, macOS Terminal, and Linux Terminal.\n",
    "- **Shell**: A shell interprets/executes commands and interfaces with the operating system. Common shells include PowerShell/Command Prompt in Windows, bash in macOS and Linux, and zsh in macOS. For example, if you issue the `ls` command in a shell (such as bash or PowerShell), the shell interprets the command, talks to the OS, and returns a list of files and directories.\n",
    "- **REPL**: A REPL (Read–Eval–Print Loop) is an interactive environment where you run code interactively, meaning that you type the code, the REPL interprets and shows results immediately using the language interpreter engine. For example, issuing the command `python` (or `python3` or `py`) in the terminal will start the Python REPL, where you write Python code to receive instant results. \n",
