    "## Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "Programmers make mistakes. For whimsical reasons, programming errors are called **bugs** and the process of tracking them down is called **debugging**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming, and especially debugging, sometimes brings out strong emotions. If you are struggling with a difficult bug, you might feel angry, sad, or embarrassed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preparing for these reactions might help you deal with them. One approach is to think of the computer as an employee with certain strengths, like speed and precision, and particular weaknesses, like lack of empathy and inability to grasp the big picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job is to be a good manager: find ways to take advantage of the strengths and mitigate the weaknesses. And find ways to use your emotions to engage with the problem, without letting your reactions interfere with your ability to work effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning to debug can be frustrating, but it is a valuable skill that is useful for many activities beyond programming. At the end of each chapter there is a section, like this one, with my suggestions for debugging. I hope they help!"

    "Three kinds of errors can occur in a program: syntax errors, runtime errors, and semantic errors.\n",
    "It is useful to distinguish between them in order to track them down more quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Syntax error**: \"Syntax\" refers to the structure of a program and the rules about that structure. If there is a syntax error anywhere in your program, Python does not run the program. It displays an error message immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Runtime error**: If there are no syntax errors in your program, it can start running. However, if an error occurs, Python displays an error message and halts execution. This type of error is called a runtime error. It is also referred to as an **exception** because it indicates that something unusual or unexpected has occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Semantic error**: The third type of error is \"semantic\", which means related to meaning. If there is a semantic error in your program, it may run without generating error messages, but it does not perform as intended. Identifying semantic errors can be tricky because it requires working backward by examining the program's output and trying to determine what it is doing."
