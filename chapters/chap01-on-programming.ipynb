    "\n",
    "Learning to program means learning a new way of thinking -- thinking like a computer scientist. This approach combines some of the best features of mathematics, engineering, and the natural sciences. Like mathematicians, computer scientists use formal languages to denote ideas -- specifically computations. Like engineers, they design things, assembling components into systems and evaluating trade-offs among alternatives. Like scientists, they observe the behavior of complex systems, form hypotheses, and test predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Natural languages** are the languages that people use to communicate, such as English, Spanish, and French. They were not designed by people; they evolved naturally. **Formal languages** are languages that are designed by people for specific applications. For example, the notation that mathematicians use is a formal language that is particularly good at denoting relationships among numbers and symbols. Similarly, programming languages are formal languages designed to express computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start with the most basic elements of programming and work our way up. In this chapter, we'll see how Python represents *numbers*, *letters*, *words*, and *arithmetic operations*. You will also begin to learn the **vocabulary of programming**, including terms such as **operator**, **expression**, **value**, and **type**. This vocabulary is important — you will need it to understand materials like this book, to design computational solutions to problems, and to communicate effectively with other programmers."
