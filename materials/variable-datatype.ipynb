    "\n",
    "1. Length: Names can be as long as you like.\n",
    "2. Containing: They can contain alphanumeric characters (letters and numbers) and underscores. Special characters (e.g., @, #, $) are not allowed.\n",
    "3. Begin with: Can begin with an underscore or a letter, but can't begin with a number.\n",
    "4. Letter Case:\n",
    "   1. It is conventional to use only **lowercase** letters for variable names, although it is legal to use uppercase letters.\n",
    "   2. Names are case-sensitive. `age`, `Age`, and `AGE` are three distinct variables.\n",
    "   3. Use **`snake_case`**: All lowercase with underscores between words. Example: total_price, student_name, is_active.\n",
    "   4. Class/type names follow the CapWords, or `upper camel case`, convention. \n",
    "7. Avoid **keywords** and **built-in function** names for naming variables.\n",
    "8. Constants: Constants are usually defined on a module level and written in all capital letters with underscores separating words.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only punctuation that can appear in a variable name is the underscore character, `_`. It is often used in names with multiple words, such as `your_name` or  `airspeed_of_unladen_swallow`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you give a variable an illegal name, you get a syntax error.\n",
